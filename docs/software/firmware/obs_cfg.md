# OpenBikeSensor configuration

This file describes the configuration format of the OBS internal(!)
configuration file. Please note that even that the format seems well
documented, it is considered an internal format which might change at
any time. There might be interpretations possible in which case 
the current implementation defines the correct used. 

The configuration is prepared for extension to support configuration 
presets, where certain values of the "default" configuration can be
changed for a certain presets. The handle bar offsets are very likely
candidates for this. The Wi-Fi or Portal configuration is more likely 
not part of a presets.

When working with backups please note that the configuration file contains 
your Wi-Fi password, and the portal token in plain text. 
Both values are secrets that should not be disclosed, so keep the backup
at a save place and replace these values when sharing.

## cfg.obs

Use the annotated sample file as documentation, order of the keys is not
relevant put the order of the array content.
