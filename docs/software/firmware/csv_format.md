# Format specification for the internal CSV format

## Encoding

The whole data file is encoded as UTF-8. Writers of the file may choose not to use the whole unicode range for simplicity and restrict themselves to 7-bit ASCII for simplicity, because it is identical with UTF-8. The OBS does this for example, since it only produces data that can be encoded this way. Parsers should interpret the whole file as UTF-8 however, since other data sources may produce special characters inside the file, such as in free text comment fields.

The file must not include a [BOM](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Order_Mark).

## Metadata

The 1st line of the CSV file contains key value metadata as URL encoded 
parameters. This line must be skipped to get a full CVS conform format. 
A sample line could look like follows:

```URL
OBSFirmwareVersion=v0.3.999&OBSDataFormat=2&DataPerMeasurement=3&\
MaximumMeasurementsPerLine=60&OffsetLeft=30&OffsetRight=30&\
NumberOfDefinedPrivacyAreas=3&PrivacyLevelApplied=AbsolutePrivacy&\
MaximumValidFlightTimeMicroseconds=18560&\
DistanceSensorsUsed=HC-SR04/JSN-SR04T&DeviceId=ecec
```

There might be new keys added. Parsers should ignore values they do not 
understand.

| Key | Example value | Note |
| --- | ------------- | ---- |
| `OBSDataFormatVersion` | `2` | **Required**. This the version of this format specification that the file follows. |
| `OBSFirmwareVersion` | `v0.3.999` | |
| `DataPerMeasurement` | `3` | fix as of now is `Tms<n>`, `Lus<n>` and `Rus<n>` |
| `MaximumMeasurementsPerLine` | `60` | currently fix |
| `HandlebarOffsetLeft` | `30` | as set in the configurations |
| `HandlebarOffsetRight` | `30` | as set in the configurations |
| `NumberOfDefinedPrivacyAreas` | `3` | as set in the configuration, just to be aware of |
| `PrivacyLevelApplied` | `AbsolutePrivacy` | One of: NoPrivacy, NoPosition, OverridePrivacy, AbsolutePrivacy |
| `MaximumValidFlightTimeMicroseconds` | `18560` | all echo times above this value must be discarded and treated as no object in sight |
| `DistanceSensorsUsed` | `HC-SR04/JSN-SR04T` | enum currently only one possible value |
| `DeviceId` | `affe` | internal Id of the OBS |
| `PresetId` | `Wade` | Id to identify the selected preset. A owner might define multiple presets |
| `BluetoothEnabled` | `1` | 1 if bluetooth is enabled, 0 otherwise
| `TrackId` | `38605ba-76...` | A uuid that can be used to uniquely identify the track.
| `TimeZone` | `GPS` | The time zone used to write Date and Time data. Typically this is GPS which is some leap seconds ahead of UTC (as of today 18). UTC is also a allowed value and the default if not TimeZone is given.

## CSV

As 2nd line, the file contains a header line with headline entries for 
each field, the names must be the same as given in the table below. 
The number of data entries per line can differ.

If there is no value in an entry this means no measurement or not 
available or hidden. Before we used `-1` or `NaN` for this, now we are 
less polite and save the space.

There is typically one line per second, but there are possible exceptions:
- Timing might be bad, and we miss one second, use the `Millis` field if 
  you need more precise timings.
- If we have multiple confirmed measurements in one interval in that case 
  an interval appears multiple times - once with each confirmed value. 
  Other fields are identical in both lines.  

The header defines the order of the fields, it can be different from
the order here. Also fields that do not appear in the header must be 
assumed empty for the whole file.


NOTE: The order of the fields is different from Version 1 of the CVS file.

### CSV-DIALECT 

Based on http://dataprotocols.org/csv-dialect/ the definition is:

```json
{
  "csvddfVersion": 1.2,
  "delimiter": ";",
  "lineTerminator": "\n",
  "skipInitialSpace": true,
  "header": true
}
```

### Data

Headline    | Format | Range | Sample | Description |
---         | --- | --- | --- | --- |
`Date`      | TT.MM.YYYY | | 24.11.2020 | Time, typically as received by the GPS module. If there was no reception of a time signal yet, this might be unix time (starting 1.1.1970) which can be used as offset between the csv lines. Expect none linearity when time is set.    
`Time`      | HH:MM:SS | | 12:00:00 | TimeZone is GPS or UTC according to the TimeZone metadata.
`Millis`    | int32  | 0-2^31 | 1234567 | Millisecond counter will continuously increase throughout the file, for time difference calculation
`Comment`   | char[] |  |  | Space to leave a short text comment 
`Latitude`  | double | -90.0-90.0 | 42.123456 | Latitude as degrees
`Longitude` | double | -180.0-180.0 | 9.123456 | Longitude in degrees
`Altitude`  | double | -9999.9-17999.9 | 480.12 | meters above mean sea level (GPGGA)
`Course`    | double | 0-359.9 | 42 | Course over ground in degrees (GPRMC)
`Speed`     | double | 0-359.9 | 42.0 | Speed over ground in km/h
`HDOP`      | double | 0-99.9 | 2.3  | Relative accuracy of horizontal position (GPGGA)
`Satellites` | int16 | 0-99 | 5 | Number of satellites in use (GPGGA)
`BatteryLevel` | double | 0-9.99 | 3.3 | Current battery level reading (~V)
`Left`      | int16  | 0-999 | 150 | Left minimum measured distance in centimeters of this line, the measurement is already corrected for the handlebar offset. 
`Right`     | int16  | 0-999 | 150 | Right minimum measured distance as `Left` above.
`Confirmed` | int32  | 0-60 | 5 | If !=0 the Measurement was confirmed overtaking by button press, contains the index `<n>` of the related measurement    
`Marked`    | char[]  | | "OVERTAKING" | Measurement was marked (not possible yet) with the given tag use <code>&#124;</code> to separate multiple tags is needed. 
`Invalid`   | int16  | 0-1 | 1 | Measurement was marked as invalid reading (not possible yet)
`InsidePrivacyArea`| int16 | 0-1 | 1 | 
`Factor`    | double |   | 58 | The factor used to calculate the time given in micro seconds (us) into centimeters (cm). Currently fix, might get adjusted by temperature some time later. |
`Measurements` | int16  | 0-999 | 18 | Number of measurements entries in this line |
_comment_   | | | | Now follows a series of #`Measurements` repetitions of #`DatasPerMeasurement` entries, `<n>` is always increased starting from 1 for the 1st measurement. Order is always the same, additional data might be added to the end, `DatasPerMeasurement` will be increased then.  |
`Tms<n>`    | int16   | 0-1999 | 234 | Millisecond (ms) offset of measurement in this series (line) of measurements |
`Lus<n>`    | int32  | 0-100000 | 3456 | Microseconds (us) till the echo was received by the left sensor, divide by the `Factor` given above to get the distance in centimeters you might also want to apply the handlebar offset given in the metadata. Empty for no measurement taken. Values above `MaximumValidFlightTimeMicroseconds` (metadata) point to a measurement timeout when there is no object in sight.|
`Rus<n>`    | int32  | 0-100000 | 3456 | As `Lus<n>` above for the right sensor. |
